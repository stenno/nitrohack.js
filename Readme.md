#nitrohack.js

__nitrohack.js__ provides a javascript client for [nitrohack\_server](http://github.com/DanielT/NitroHack). 

This basically allows to play [NetHack](http://nethack.org) using javascript. All communication is wrapped in javascript functions, and hooks for message and event callbacks are provided. __nitrohack.js__ also stores and keeps track of the current game state, for example the map and attributes.

__nitrohack.js__ uses [node.js](http://nodejs.org), so it has to be installed on the client system.
